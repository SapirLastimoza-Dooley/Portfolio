description: >
  Currently, the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) is based on the North American Datum of 1986 (NAD 83) and the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). These datum have worked well so far but a few errors have been found. The NAD 83 datum is non-geocentric, meaning the datum which should be centered at the center of the earth is actually off by about 2.2 meters compared to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). The NAVD 88 datum is both biased by 1.1 meters and tilted. This error is due to both the technique in which the data was gathered as well as the nature of the location of the survey marks. The data was gathered using ground-based surveying techniques, which are subject to a higher rate of human error, using Electronic Distance Meters, Theodolites, Total Stations, Leveling, and GPS receivers. In addition, many survey marks were set in passive locations, meaning the position of the mark is subject to change over time: either through human interaction, a change in the landscape, or complete removal.
