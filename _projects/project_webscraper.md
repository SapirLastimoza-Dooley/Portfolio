  The purpose of this project is to create a Python script that will read an Instagram feed and collect information based on user-inputted criteria. This script is intended to solve the challenge of collecting customer-related information through Instagram at a large scale. With this script, the user should be able to simply run the program; the program will log in to a specified account and collect information, in this case: location data of users that fit a specific set of criteria. In this proposal we shall lay out the specific functions of the script as well as the criteria that will drive data collection. With this script, the user will have their stresses alleviated in regards to the marketing aspect of their company.
