description: >
  The food council in Yavapai, Arizona has distributed 235,000 meals through the Child  Hunger and Emergency Food Provider support programs and seen much success. From 2009 to  2012, YFC increased the delivery of emergency food in the Verde Valley by 2.55 times. They  plan to develop school and community gardens in cities and towns, foster public recognition of  extreme prevalence of hunger - 1 in 4 persons, 1 in 3 children in rural AZ, and build a network of  advocates. In Apache, the percentage of household without a car has decreased by -6.54279%  while the percentage of the population with low income and low access to a grocery store has  increased by 8.130584. A majority of those with low access to grocery stores are white at  12.02833%. Establishing a program to provide low income families with food as well as teach  those families how to build community gardens has the potential to lower food insecurity in the  county. First, food insecurity must be recognized by the local government. Then educational  programs in all level of income areas on the prevalence of food insecurity in their county must be  created. Finally, once the citizens are educated and the government recognizes the problem, an  emergency food service and community garden building programs can be funded and created.
