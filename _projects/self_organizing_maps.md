caption:     Clustering analysis on the temporal characteristics of car crashes.
description: >
  Vehicle crashes happen every minute in the United States, each crash having its own time and specific attributes such as road conditions and weather. The goal of this project is to find meaningful spatial and temporal patterns from the large datasets provided by state DOTâ€™s. Using a self-organizing map, data can be clustered into meaningful clusters based on time of year, month, or day in a way that is easy to read. This allows for a more in-depth analysis. Data can then be joined to point data in ArcMap to show how patterns relate spatially within certain attributes like road conditions, number of injuries or weather conditions. The significance of this is that it allows temporal data to be joined to spatial data. This allows for multifaceted in-depth analysis. 

  Data Source: IOWA Department of Transportation
  Programs Used: ArcPro, Visual Studio Code
  Languages Used: Python- ArcPy, sompy, mathplotlib, numpy, sklearn, multiprocessing, neighborhood, normalization
  Outcomes: Maps, Heatmaps
